# Set up

this is a wechat miniprogram. use the wechat dev tools to simulate it and run it.

make sure you hve the backend running (https://github.com/git-hacker/DriverGo_Backend) on your PC first, on localhost:3000.

The code has references to URLs for the backend that may need to be changed first, e.g. 192.168.x.x:3001 can be changed to localhost:3000. Just do a full text search to find those.
